# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

*What is version control?  Why is it useful?
##Version control allows for the creation of intermediate "save points" which may be returned to as needed. This is useful as it allows for error recovery and for branching a project off into another direction.

*What is a branch and why would you use one?
## A branch is a method for allowing a project to follow multiple paths, each being reviewable and merged into a common parent. This allows projects to be developed by multiple team members simultaneously or even allows "what if" senarios to be explored.

*What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
## A commit places a verion of a project safely under version control. A good commit message let's fellow team mebers know quickly what was changed or added.

*What is a merge conflict?
## A merge conflict occurs anytime two or more merges attempt to write to the same code at the same time. A merge conflict can also occur if files being referenced in the push have been moved/ removed prior to the merge.
