Teaching a Robot to Elevate

-request input for "destination floor"
	write value of "destination floor" to memory
-determine value of "current floor"
	-utilize sub-routines to determine current location
- if "current floor = "destination floor", Naavigate to destination
	else Navigate to elevator
		-utilize sub-routines for locomotion, navigation, obsicle identification/ avoidance, ect
-identify "current floor" and compare to "destination floor"
	if current floor is < "destination floor", push "up" button
	else push "down" button
-once elevator arrives and doors open, enter elevator
	-utilize sub-routines for determining status of elevator, and locomotion
-locate floor selection panel
	-utilize sub-routine for visual identification
-select panel button that coorelates with "destination floor"
